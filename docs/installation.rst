Setting up the UK-MOSEM model is currently not a very streamlined process and might bring up issues (which can be reported via GitHub). As and when the model setup is further streamlined, more detailed installation instructions are expected to be added.

The model code and configuration files are available in the GitHub repository. The repository also includes an environment file that can be used to setup a Python environment to run the code.
