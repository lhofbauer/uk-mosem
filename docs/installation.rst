Setting up the UK-MOSEM model is currently not a very established process and might bring up issues (which can be reported via GitHub). As and when the model setup is further streamlined, more detailed installation instructions are expected to be added.

The core steps to set up UK-MOSEM are:

#. Download the model code from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/lhofbauer/uk-mosem>`_ and raw data from `Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15706872>`_ (as well as the additional data not included in the Zenodo repository as highlighted).
#. Set up a Python environment with the relevant packages. The repository includes an environment file that can be used to setup a the environment.
#. Adjust the configuration files to match the local setup.
