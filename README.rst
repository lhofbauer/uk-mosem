    UK Multi-scale Open Source Energy Model


This repository contains the model code and documentation of UK-MOSEM.

The documentation is also hosted on `ReadTheDocs <https://uk-mosem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Setting up the UK-MOSEM model is currently not a very streamlined process and might bring up issues (which can be reported via the issue tracker).
